/* This program helps users make bets on wrestling teams,
based on which team has a total weight advantage. 
First, it promps users to input the # of teammates on each
team. Then, it asks users to input the weight of each team
member, alternating between the two teams. Finally, it
declares one team as having an advantage and shares the 
total weight of each team. */
