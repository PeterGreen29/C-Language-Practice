//Activity from 2.1 of EdX C Programming MOOC with Prof Bonfert-Taylor & RÃ©mi

/* Prompt: 

You are planning a car trip so you post on a carpooling website in order to share the cost of the trip.

If you have 0 passengers the carpool site does not charge anything and you alone pay the full cost of the trip. 
If you have 1 or more passengers the carpool site adds a $1 fee to the cost of the trip and evenly divides the 
total cost ($1 fee + gas) among the passengers and you. You want to write a program that calculates the cost you 
have to pay. The program should read the number of passengers (an integer) and the cost of gas for the 
trip (a decimal number). The program should then print the cost that you have to pay (a decimal number) with 
2 digits after the decimal point. */

#include <stdio.h>
int main(void){
    int ppl; //# ppl not including yourself
    double gas;
    double pay;
    scanf("%d %lf",&ppl,&gas);
    if(ppl){
        gas = gas +1;
        pay = gas/(ppl+1); //add 1 to account for yourself
    } else {
        pay = gas;
    }
    printf("%.2lf",pay);
    return 0;
}
