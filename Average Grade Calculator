/*This code first asks users to input 
the number of test scores to be averaged. 
Then, user enters test scores one by one
until the desired # of scores is entered.
Finally, program outputs the mean of 
these scores, to 2 decimal places.

The purpose of this exercise is to
combine a variety of topics learned
& to practice converting int vars
to double vars. */
